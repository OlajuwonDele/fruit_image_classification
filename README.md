### Fruit Image Classification with Deep Learning Models
## Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements a fruit image classification system using various deep learning architectures. The project demonstrates a complete pipeline from dataset collection to model evaluation.

## Key Features
Dataset Collection: Uses DuckDuckGo Search API to scrape fruit images (grapes, grapefruit, apple, banana, mango, orange)

## Data Preprocessing:

Downloads and verifies image integrity

Implements data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flipping)

Splits data into training/validation sets

## Model Architectures:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Autoencoder Classifier

Vision Transformer (ViT)

Evaluation: Comprehensive metrics including accuracy and confusion matrices

## Performance
The models achieved the following validation accuracies:

CNN: 70.36%

Autoencoder Classifier: 68.70%

Vision Transformer: 65.10%

MLP: 39.06%

LSTM: 29.64%

The CNN model performed best, demonstrating the effectiveness of convolutional architectures for image classification tasks. The Vision Transformer showed promising results as well, indicating the potential of attention-based approaches.

## Technical Details
Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

Image Size: 150x150 pixels

Batch Size: 32

Epochs: 15

Data Augmentation: Rotation, zoom, horizontal flip

Validation Split: 20%

The notebook provides a solid foundation for image classification tasks and showcases how different architectures perform on the same dataset. The CNN model would be recommended for production use given its superior performance.
